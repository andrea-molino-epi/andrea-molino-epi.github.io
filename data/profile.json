    "blurb"   : "<p>Hello! My name is Pelle Tracey. I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Information School. Iâ€™m a multi-method scholar broadly interested in how automated technologies, AI, and recordkeeping work in practice, particularly when deployed in frontline government or rental housing contexts. My current research is an ethnographic investigation of automation in homeless services coordinated entry systems. My work draws from, and contributes to, critical data studies, archival studies, computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), and housing studies. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I was advised by Dr. Patricia Garcia.</p> Here is my CV and Google Scholar.
