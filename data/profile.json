Through my 9+ years of experience, I have developed expertise in epidemiologic methods, study design, effective data visualization, and scientific and commentary writing.<p>My work has been multidisciplinary, leading to a deep appreciation of the multifaceted nature of public health challenges. My interests lie at the intersection of epidemiology and health services research, with my dissertation focusing on HPV self-sampling and understanding how we can make cancer screening more accessible for all.<p>Prior to my PhD, I was as a research coordinator for a number of organ transplantation clinical trials, and a staff epidemiologist for a <a href='https://statepi.jhsph.edu/ckid/'>large cohort study</a> of children with chronic kidney disease.",
