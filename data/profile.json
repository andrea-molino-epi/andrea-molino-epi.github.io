    "blurb"   : "<p>Hello! My name is Pelle Tracey. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I am advised by Dr. Patricia Garcia. I am part of the Culturally Responsive Computing and Anthrotech Labs, and am the Research Operations Lead for the Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing. I use a mixture of methods to investigate infrastructure, bureaucracy, algorithms, and data work, particularly in frontline government contexts. My current work uses ethnographic methods to examine how cities in the US make sense of homelessness through data, and how people experiencing homelessness make sense of this state response. My work draws from, and contributes to, CSCW, Critical Data Studies, Media Studies, and HCI.</p>",
