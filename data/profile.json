My work draws from, and contributes to, critical data studies, archival studies, computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), and housing studies.<p>Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I was advised by Dr. Patricia Garcia. Before that, I was a case manager, a permanent supportive housing program manager, and a short order cook.",
